#### Educational Groups - Non-Public Weekday Matinees (Field Trips)

Kudzu Playhouse is glad to welcome educational groups such as schools, pre-schools, homeschoolers, after school care, day care, and Mother’s Day Out to enjoy our shows.  Please contact us regarding having your educational group attend one of our specially scheduled, non-public, weekday matinee performances (aka field trips).  

Tickets: We are honored to be able to provide educational group discount rates for these particular performances. Tickets are $6 per person (regardless of age), and there is no charge for teachers who are chaperoning the group. We welcome other adults (parents, grandparents, etc.) to accompany the group and pay the same $6 rate, but they must purchase their ticket(s) with the group at the time the booking request is submitted. We do not sell individual tickets, nor is the box office open, for these special performances.  Please note: You will not receive individual tickets for your group, but rather, you will need to check in your group upon arrival at the theatre. 

Payment: Payment must be made at least two weeks prior to the performance date to secure your group's seating and should be made via check or money order (payable to “Kudzu Playhouse”) and mailed to:

Kudzu Field Trips<br>
P.O. Box 47<br>
Hernando, MS 38632<br>

Planning Your Visit: In consideration of all groups and their schedules, we are unable to delay the beginning of a performance because a group is running late, regardless of the reason. All groups should plan to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to performance time. No groups should arrive before 7:45 a.m. to allow for school day traffic at Hernando High and Middle Schools. No parking is allowed anywhere on the campus of Hernando High School or the adjoining streets. Parking is available at Hernando Middle School.

It is critical that you allow ample time to unload vehicles, check in, get your group into the building and be seated.  We will seat groups as they arrive, beginning at the front of the theater. If your group arrives late, we will make every attempt to seat you as quickly as possible in the rear of the theater so as not to disturb other groups or the actors. Any adults accompanying groups of children are requested to please seat themselves at the ends of the rows so that everyone can have an unobstructed view of the performance.

Cancellation: Kudzu Playhouse recognizes that plans can change. Should you need to cancel your group, we require at least one (1) weeks’ notice to be able to issue a refund, less a 10% processing fee. We are not able to issue a refund for cancellations received less than one week from the performance date.

Non-public weekday matinee performances for educational groups are available for many of our Kudzu & Kidzu shows.  Check our season schedule for upcoming shows.

To schedule your educational group for a non-public weekday matinee performance and take advantage of the group discount rate, please submit a Field Trip Group Request, and someone will be in touch with you.
