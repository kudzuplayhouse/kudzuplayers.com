KUDZU PLAYHOUSE RECEIVES MISSISSIPPI ARTS COMMISSION GRANT

Jackson, Mississippi, August 21, 2016 -- Kudzu Playhouse of Hernando has been awarded a $4,100 grant from the Mississippi Arts Commission (MAC). This grant is a portion of the $1.5 million in grants the Commission will award in 2016-2017 and will be used to create a greater awareness of the arts, specifically theatre, by providing and creating opportunities for instruction and education through camps, workshops, classes, and productions.  The grants are made possible by continued funding from the Mississippi State Legislature and the National Endowment for the Arts.

“Organizations that support the arts play a pivotal role in growing Mississippi’s creative economy,” said Malcolm White, Executive Director of MAC. “The Mississippi Arts Commission is pleased to support their work, which reinforces the value of the arts for communities and for the economic development of our state.”

Founded in 1983, Kudzu Playhouse has a long and distinguished history as the oldest community theater in DeSoto County, Mississippi.  Its mission is to bring performing arts to the community by showcasing talented actors and actresses of all ages, while also nurturing and developing young future performers, regardless of gender, race or socioeconomic background. Kudzu prides itself on being a "teaching" theater, making the arts, and education in the arts, accessible to all members of the community.

The Mississippi Arts Commission, a state agency, serves the residents of the state by providing grants that support programs to enhance communities; assist artists and arts organizations; promote the arts in education and celebrate Mississippi’s cultural heritage. Established in 1968, the Mississippi Arts Commission is funded by the Mississippi Legislature, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mississippi Endowment for the Arts at the Community Foundation of Greater Jackson and other private sources. The agency serves as an active supporter and promoter of arts in community life and in arts education.

For information from the Mississippi Arts Commission, contact Melia Dicker, Communications Director, 601-359-6546 or mdicker@arts.ms.gov.
